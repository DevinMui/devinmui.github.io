		{ "title": "Hello world", "body": "<p>So I decided to completely redo my website again. This time, it comes with a kind of posting system so I can kind of write blog posts through a JSON file known as <a href=\"https://github.com/DevinMui/devinmui.github.io/blob/master/blog.json\">blog.json</a>. Anyways, I think it\'s kinda cool and if you want to check out how I write posts, just click <a href=\"http://devinmui.github.io/blog.html\">here</a>.</p><p>Some introductions, my name is Devin Mui. I\'m a high school sophomore studying at Dublin High School. I really like writing code. Especially on the back end with Ruby on Rails. I\'m starting to get more into open source stuff I guess. I\'ve been to a bunch of hackathons. Red Bull helped me make this site.</p><p>Currently, I want to make a little tool in Node or Python so that when I press a button on the <a href=\"http://devinmui.github.io/blog.html\">blog.html</a> page, it\'ll grab the JSON generated, append that to the current JSON, and commit changes to add a new blog post. I don\'t know. It sounds neat.</p><p>This page will also serve some of my friends who want to learn how to program. Sure these posts won\'t really help that much, but yeah. </p><img src=\"http://exmoorpet.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/cat.png\"/><pre><code>let cat = \"fluffy\"</code></pre><p>Well, that\'s the end of my first post I guess.</p><p>Post written by <a href=\"https://github.com/devinmui\">Devin Mui</a></p>" }
