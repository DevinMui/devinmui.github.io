I want to become a software engineer/computer scientist/electrical engineer. I plan to go to college and majoring in electrical engineering or computer science in order to achieve these goals. I want to work on building projects that people will use from around the world.

I have always wanted to help people and make their lives easier, whether it is from connecting masses of people from around the world together, building drones to help farmers, or by building a game that kids could play on their phones. I go to many hackathons where I make winning projects in 24 - 48 hours from nothing.

I am a leader. I have always led my team through every hackathon and won 7 awards at them. I take risks and move really fast.
